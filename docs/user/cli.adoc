== CLI

Core `kbdgen` functionality will be within the subcommand `target`, that then allows to select
among the various linguistic targets: Windows, MacOS, .svg, etc.

Example usage:

`cargo run -- target --bundle-path C:\Projects\Divvun\keyboards\keyboard-sme\sme.kbdgen --output-path C:\KbdgenBuilds\sme_mac macos generate`

The first argument is the location of the given .kbdgen bundle (see below for 
information on bundles) that the keyboard should be built from.

The second argument is the output path.

And the third argument is the desired target.
