== Notes (Windows)

Good sneaky website for windows that apparently exists: https://kbdlayout.info/



BMP = Basic Multilingual Plane. The true encoding Windows .klc actually expects: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane

This means characters > 0xFFFF cannot be represented in .klc at all.

SGCap, see: https://kbdlayout.info/features/SGCAPS

Copied from site in case it goes down:

"Some keyboards do not associate the CapsLock and Shift keys together for all keystrokes; 
instead, pressing the CapsLock key defines an additional two shift states for specific keys. 
Therefore, some languages cannot by typed without the CapsLock key. The "SG" in the name 
orginiates from the first keyboard layout to use the functionality, the Swiss German 
keyboard layout."

While alt caps is mentioned as a potential layer, it does not seem to be used.
