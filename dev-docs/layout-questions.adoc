== YAML Questions

What are `displayNames`? Why is that the name?

`modes` -> `layers`

Layers need to be organized better than they currently are. Some considerations:

* what do they have in comon?
* how are they actually used?
* there seem to be some that become mobile layers, and some desktop layers.
Is there more than these two categories?
* disentangle file structure from the model we actually want to end up with.

== Targets

Target files seem random and very specific to a given target.

== Implementation

For a given layout file, `layers` need to correspond to target files.

Create a trait for the build process. Each target would implement this trait,
which would include in it a number of build steps. The build steps will be named,
and can either be executed all at once, or one can be chosen. No state
tracking is planned for `kbdgen` at this time.

What to do for targets that do not have keyboard layers, or the extra layers?
