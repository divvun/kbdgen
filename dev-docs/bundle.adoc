= Bundle

Summary of Bundle Structure:

Kbdgen Bundles describe desired keyboard `layouts`.

There is one `layout` file per `language tag` (i.e., `se-FI` (Northern Sami (Finland)))

The `layout` may be described for multiple `targets`, i.e., groupings of `platforms`.

A given `target` may support one or more `platforms`.

Within a `platform` are the supported keyboard `layers`, i.e., `default`, `shift`, `caps` (for caps lock), etc.
