== Build System

All builds are to implemented as io steps with no 
arguments or return types except the bundle and output path.

Builds are expected to be per major target (i.e., Windows, 
MacOS, ChromeOS, iOS).

A given build must implement the following trait:

```
#[async_trait(?Send)]
pub trait BuildSteps {
    fn populate_steps(&mut self);
    fn count(&self) -> usize;
    async fn build_full(&self);
}
```

And, subsequently, every step in the build must implement this trait:

```
#[async_trait(?Send)]
pub trait BuildStep {
    async fn build(&self, bundle: Arc<KbdgenBundle>, output_path: &Path);
}
```
