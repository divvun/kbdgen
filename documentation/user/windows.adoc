== Windows

Generating a Windows keyboard layout in the current implementation of `kbdgen` mainly
concerns the generation of .klc files, and then subsequent building of those files
on a Windows system.

KLC is Windows's format for keyboard layouts, meaning Keyboard
Layout Creator, which is also the tool that can be used to view and modify
.klc files. The tool can be downloaded from Microsoft:

Installing MSKLC requires enabling .NET Framework 3.5 in Windows Programs and Features.

\.klc is a format that has specific requirements for how a keyboard is described and
must be encoded as UTF-16, with Windows style CRLF, or the file will be perceived
as invalid.

For details on the .klc format, please see the developer documentation.
